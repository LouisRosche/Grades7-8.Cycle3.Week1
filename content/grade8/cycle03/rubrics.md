## Week 1 Rubrics

### Station 1: Misconception Check
**SEP:** Analyzing Data | **DCI:** PS2.A | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** When a 50 kg cheetah contacts a 25 kg gazelle during a chase, compare the forces.
**Correct Answer:** c) Forces are equal

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies forces as EQUAL + invokes N3L + may note different accelerations | "The forces are equal (Newton's Third Law: for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction). Even though the cheetah is bigger, both exert the same force. The ACCELERATIONS are different—the smaller gazelle accelerates more." |
| **3** | Correctly identifies forces as equal + mentions N3L | "The forces are equal because of Newton's Third Law." |
| **2** | Correctly identifies forces as equal but no explanation | "They're the same force." |
| **1** | Incorrect - states larger animal exerts more force | "The cheetah exerts more force because it's bigger." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Answer (a) "Cheetah exerts more" → MOST COMMON ERROR. Conflates force with size. Remediate with paired object demos.
- Answer (b) "Gazelle exerts more" → Rare. May be random guessing.
- Answer (d) "Can't determine" → Conflating force with acceleration; lacks N3L confidence.

### Station 1: Calculation Verification

**Questions:** Force (500N expected), Cheetah acceleration, Gazelle acceleration

| Score | Criteria | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **4** | All three correct: Force = 500N, Cheetah a = 10 m/s², Gazelle a = 20 m/s² | Full credit |
| **3** | Two of three correct OR all with minor arithmetic errors | Partial credit |
| **2** | One correct OR correct setup with execution errors | Needs calculation support |
| **1** | Incorrect setup but some relevant physics vocabulary | Needs conceptual review |
| **0** | No response or completely incorrect | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Force ≠ 500N → Didn't apply N3L correctly; thinks forces unequal
- Cheetah acceleration > gazelle → Inverted relationship; review a = F/m
- Wrong units → Review dimensional analysis

### Station 1: Evolutionary Insight
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** LS4.B | **CCC:** Cause and Effect

**Question:** Based on your calculations, why might being SMALLER give prey an advantage during predator contact?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Connects lower mass → higher acceleration + survival advantage + uses F=ma | "From F=ma, if force is equal but mass is smaller, acceleration is greater (a=F/m). So when predator and prey collide, smaller prey gets pushed away FASTER, giving more distance to escape. This is why many prey evolved smaller sizes." |
| **3** | Connects lower mass → higher acceleration + mentions survival | "Smaller animals accelerate faster when hit with same force, so they escape better." |
| **2** | Mentions acceleration or escape but connection incomplete | "Smaller is faster." |
| **1** | Incorrect reasoning | "Smaller animals can hide better." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Lamarckian Misconception Check

**Question:** After the simulation, why did the population change?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Explains differential survival without individual change | "More of one color survived because they were harder to catch. The individuals didn't change—more of them survived to reproduce." |
| **3** | Correct explanation but less precise | "The camouflaged ones survived better." |
| **2** | Partially correct | "Some beans were better." |
| **1** | Lamarckian misconception | "The beans learned to avoid being caught." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP 6 + DCI LS4.B + CCC Cause and Effect**

**Question:** Predict what will happen to brown/green insects over 100 generations with a new visual predator. Explain using both natural selection AND physics concepts.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Correct prediction + natural selection mechanism + physics connection + quantitative | "Over 100 generations, the better-camouflaged color will increase in frequency. Predators exert 'selection pressure'—like a force pushing the population toward certain traits. Insects that blend in survive to reproduce. Physics: Smaller/faster insects (higher a=F/m) might also escape, so speed traits might also be selected." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Correct prediction + mechanism + physics (weaker integration) | "The color that blends in will become more common because predators catch visible ones. It's like a force selecting traits." |
| **2** | ~SEP ✓DCI ✗CCC | Correct prediction + natural selection OR physics (not both) | "Green insects will die if tree is brown, so brown becomes common." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Correct prediction but no mechanism OR incorrect | "They'll all turn brown eventually." (Lamarckian) |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 Lamarckian: "Insects will change their color to survive" → Individual adaptation misconception; emphasize POPULATION change
- Score 2 physics-only: Focus on escape without inheritance → Connect physics TO inheritance
- Score 3 analogy-only: Uses "force" metaphor but doesn't quantify → Push for numerical prediction

## Week 2 Rubrics

### Station 1: Homologous Structures Reasoning

**Question:** Which is more likely - independent evolution or common ancestor? Explain.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (common ancestor) + parsimony reasoning + evidence | "Common ancestor is more likely. It's simpler to explain one origin with modifications than 4 separate origins of same bone pattern. The similarities are too specific for coincidence." |
| **3** | Correct + basic reasoning | "Common ancestor, because it's unlikely 4 animals would evolve same bones by chance." |
| **2** | Correct but weak reasoning | "Common ancestor." |
| **1** | Incorrect OR correct with wrong reasoning | "Independent evolution because they live in different environments." |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Station 2: Rate of Change Calculation

**Question:** Calculate average rate of leg length change over 55 million years.

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (0.73 cm/My) + clear work + units | "(60-20)/55 = 40/55 = 0.73 cm per million years" |
| **3** | Correct method with minor error OR correct without units | "40/55 = 0.7 cm" |
| **2** | Correct setup but wrong execution | "60-20 = 40... 40 × 55 = 2200" |
| **1** | Attempt with conceptual error | "60/55 = 1.09" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D)
**SEP 6 + DCI LS4.B/PS2.A + CCC Cause and Effect**

**Question:** Predict how a mouse population might change as habitat gets colder over thousands of years.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Correct + mechanism + physics/energy + multiple traits | "Mice with larger body size would be selected for because larger bodies have lower surface area to volume ratio, meaning less heat loss (physics). Thicker fur would also be selected. Over thousands of years, the population would shift toward 'cold-adapted' traits." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Correct + natural selection + physics OR multiple traits | "Bigger mice survive better because they lose less heat. Natural selection would favor larger individuals." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Correct + one mechanism | "Mice would get thicker fur to stay warm." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Prediction without mechanism OR Lamarckian | "The mice would grow thicker fur because they're cold." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Bigger animals exert more force | Forces are always equal (N3L) | "What does Newton's Third Law say?" |
| Only moving objects exert forces | All objects can exert forces | "What force does the floor exert on you?" |
| Evolution = individual change | Evolution = population change | "Does the mouse get faster, or do faster mice survive?" |
