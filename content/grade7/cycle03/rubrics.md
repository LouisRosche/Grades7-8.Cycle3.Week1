## Week 1 Rubrics

### Station 1: Misconception Check
**SEP:** Constructing Explanations | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** Student A says: "When CO₂ absorbs energy, it breaks the bonds." Student B says: "The bonds don't break, they just vibrate." Who is correct and why?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correctly identifies Student B + explains using bond energy + connects to Cycle 2 | "Student B is correct. The bonds don't break because breaking bonds requires MORE energy than IR provides. From Cycle 2, we learned breaking bonds is endothermic. The IR just makes bonds vibrate faster." |
| **3** | Correctly identifies Student B + explains using bond energy OR vibration | "Student B is correct because breaking bonds takes a lot of energy. The IR just makes the molecule shake." |
| **2** | Correctly identifies Student B but explanation incomplete | "Student B is correct because CO₂ molecules vibrate when they absorb heat." |
| **1** | Incorrect identification OR correct with wrong reasoning | "Student A is correct because energy breaks things apart." |
| **0** | No response OR completely irrelevant | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1 pattern: "Student A is correct because absorbing energy gives molecules enough energy to break" → Reveals bond energy misconception
- Score 2 pattern: Circular reasoning ("vibrates because it vibrates") → Needs deeper probing

### Station 2: Mass Tracking Calculation

**Question:** A tree absorbs 48 lbs of CO₂ per year. How many pounds of carbon is that? (CO₂ is 27% carbon by mass)

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct answer (12.9-13.1 lbs) + clear work | "48 × 0.27 = 12.96 lbs of carbon" |
| **3** | Correct answer with partial work OR minor rounding (12.5-13.5) | "About 13 lbs" with partial work |
| **2** | Correct setup but calculation error | "48 × 27 = 1296" (forgot percentage conversion) |
| **1** | Incorrect setup or major error | "48 - 27 = 21 lbs" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

**Common Errors:**
- Multiplying by 27 instead of 0.27 → Review percentage conversion
- Subtracting instead of multiplying → Review "of" means multiply

### Station 2: Conservation Check
**SEP:** Engaging in Argument | **DCI:** PS1.B | **CCC:** Energy and Matter

**Question:** A student says "When we burn fossil fuels, we're creating new carbon that goes into the atmosphere." Is this correct?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Refutes + invokes conservation of mass + explains carbon origin | "This is incorrect because of conservation of mass—atoms can't be created. The carbon was already in fossil fuels from ancient plants. Burning just releases it back to atmosphere as CO₂." |
| **3** | Refutes + mentions conservation OR explains origin | "No, we're not creating carbon. The carbon was already in the fossil fuel from millions of years ago." |
| **2** | Refutes but explanation incomplete | "No, we can't create atoms." |
| **1** | Incorrect or partially correct with errors | "Yes, burning creates new carbon because fire makes things." |
| **0** | No response or irrelevant | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D Assessment)
**SEP 7 + DCI PS1.B/ESS3.D + CCC Energy and Matter**

**Question:** A company claims their product "destroys carbon pollution." Evaluate this claim.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Refutes using conservation + explains what likely happens + demonstrates carbon cycle understanding | "This claim is scientifically impossible. Carbon can't be destroyed (conservation of mass). The product might convert carbon from one form to another (like capturing CO₂ and storing it), but the carbon atoms still exist." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Refutes using conservation + partial explanation | "They can't destroy carbon because atoms aren't destroyed in reactions. They probably just move or store it." |
| **2** | ~SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Recognizes claim is problematic but explanation weak | "I don't think you can destroy carbon pollution completely." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ✗DCI ✗CCC | Accepts claim or major misconceptions | "It's probably true if they have the right chemicals." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

**Distractor Analysis:**
- Score 1: "Strong chemicals can break down anything" → Mass destruction misconception; return to manipulatives
- Score 2: Correct intuition but can't articulate → Provide sentence frames
- Score 3: Conservation correct but doesn't track WHERE carbon goes → Use carbon cycle diagram

## Week 2 Rubrics

### Station 1: Feedback Loop Completion

**Question:** Complete: Ice melts → albedo _____ → energy absorbed _____ → temperature _____ → more ice _____

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | All 4 correct + can explain WHY | "decreases, increases, increases, melts — because dark water absorbs more than white ice" |
| **3** | All 4 correct OR 3 correct with explanation | "decreases, increases, increases, melts" |
| **2** | 2-3 blanks correct | "decreases, increases, stays same, melts" |
| **1** | 1 blank correct or logic reversed | "increases, decreases, decreases, freezes" |
| **0** | No response or all incorrect | Blank |

### Station 2: pH Calculation

**Question:** If ocean pH dropped 0.1 over 50 years, how long until it drops another 0.15?

| Score | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Correct (75 years) + clear work + units | "Rate = 0.1/50 = 0.002/year. Time = 0.15/0.002 = 75 years" |
| **3** | Correct with partial work OR correct method with arithmetic error | "75 years" or "0.15 ÷ 0.002 = 70 years" |
| **2** | Correct rate but wrong final | "0.002 per year, so... 50 years?" |
| **1** | Attempt with conceptual error | "0.1 + 0.15 = 0.25 years" |
| **0** | No response | Blank |

### Exit Ticket: Integration (3D)
**SEP 7 + DCI ESS3.D + CCC Stability and Change**

**Question:** Evaluate the proposal to paint roofs white to combat climate change.

| Score | 3D Check | Criteria | Example Response |
|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| **4** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ✓CCC | Evaluates using albedo + acknowledges limitations + connects to carbon cycle | "White roofs increase albedo, reflecting more sunlight and reducing absorption. This lowers local temps and reduces AC energy use (which reduces CO₂). However, it doesn't remove existing CO₂—it's a partial solution." |
| **3** | ✓SEP ✓DCI ~CCC | Evaluates using albedo + partial bigger picture | "White roofs reflect sunlight so buildings stay cooler. Good because less energy absorbed. But won't fix climate change completely." |
| **2** | ~SEP ✓DCI ✗CCC | Correct albedo reasoning but no system connection | "White reflects, so roofs would be cooler." |
| **1** | ✗SEP ~DCI ✗CCC | Opinion without scientific reasoning | "I think it's a good idea because white is cooler." |
| **0** | ✗all | No response | Blank |

## Quick Reference: Common Misconceptions

| Misconception | Correct Understanding | Probing Question |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|
| Breaking bonds releases energy | Breaking bonds REQUIRES energy | "Where does the energy for breaking come from?" |
| Mass disappears in reactions | Mass is conserved | "Where do the atoms go?" |
| CO₂ breaks apart when absorbing IR | CO₂ vibrates faster | "What would it take to actually break the bonds?" |
