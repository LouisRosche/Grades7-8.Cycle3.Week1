### Tuesday, December 16 (65 min) — Assessment Day 1

| Time | Activity | Teacher Actions |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Setup | Students log in, open Canvas |
| 0:03-0:05 | Instructions | Read assessment rules |
| 0:05-0:20 | Part 1: Synthesis | Circulate silently; no help on content |

**Assessment Rules (Read to Class):**
> "This is a formal assessment. You may not talk to classmates or look at their screens.
> If you have a question about what a question MEANS, raise your hand.
> I cannot help with the ANSWER.
> You cannot go back once you submit each part.
> Take your time and think carefully."

### Wednesday, December 17 (45 min) — Assessment Day 2

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0:00-0:03 | Setup | Log in, open Canvas |
| 0:03-0:05 | Instructions | "Last part - Misconception Check" |
| 0:05-0:25 | Part 3: Misconception | 20 min timed |
| 0:25-0:30 | Immediate Debrief | "How did it feel? Any surprises?" |
| 0:30-0:45 | Self-Reflection | Students write what they'd study more |

---

### Thursday, December 18 (65 min) — Remediation

| Time | Activity | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| 0:00-0:10 | Return Scores | Share Part 1 & 2 scores (Part 3 still grading) |
| 0:10-0:40 | Targeted Remediation | Small groups by misconception |
| 0:40-0:55 | Second Chance | Students can redo 1 question for partial credit |
| 0:55-0:65 | Cycle Wrap | "What will you remember from Cycle 3?" |

**Remediation Groups:**
- **Group A:** Bond energy misconception (broke vs. required)
- **Group B:** Conservation of mass (atoms don't disappear)
- **Group C:** Feedback confusion (positive doesn't mean good)

## Grading Guide

### Part 1: Synthesis (20 pts)

| Q | Points | Key Elements |
|---|--------|--------------|
| Q1 | 5 | Diagram connects all 4 processes with arrows |
| Q2 | 5 | Identifies CO2 emissions as primary driver |
| Q3 | 5 | Explains greenhouse + feedback + acceleration |
| Q4 | 5 | Connects fossil fuel carbon to ancient plants |

### Part 2: Cumulative Assessment (60 pts)

| Section | Points | Learning Targets Assessed |
|---------|--------|---------------------------|
| A: Greenhouse | 15 | W1-1 (CO2 mechanism), W1-4 (bond energy) |
| B: Carbon Cycle | 15 | W1-2 (tracing carbon), Cycle 2 (conservation) |
| C: Albedo/Feedback | 15 | W2-1 (albedo), W2-2 (feedback model) |
| D: Integration | 15 | W1+W2 synthesis, SEP-1 (asking questions) |

### Part 3: Misconception Check (20 pts)

| Q | Points | Misconception Targeted |
|---|--------|------------------------|
| MC1a | 5 | "Breaking bonds releases energy" |
| MC1b | 5 | Apply bond energy to CO2 vibration |
| MC2a | 5 | "Mass disappears" |
| MC2b | 5 | Conservation of mass (Cycle 2) |

## Answer Key Highlights

### Part 1
- **Q2:** Increased CO2 from human emissions (NOT ice melting or albedo change)
- **Q4:** Carbon from ancient plants via photosynthesis (conservation)

### Part 2
- **A1:** Vibrates faster (NOT breaks apart)
- **A3:** H2O has 3 atoms + bent shape (pattern recognition)
- **B1:** 24 × 0.27 = 6.48 lbs carbon
- **B2:** Released as CO2 (conservation)
- **C2:** Dark ocean exposed → More heat absorbed (positive feedback)

### Part 3
- **MC1a:** Breaking bonds REQUIRES energy (most missed question)
- **MC2a:** Escaped as gases (CO2, H2O) into the air

## Data Analysis Plan

### After Assessment
1. Export all responses to spreadsheet
2. Calculate question-level percentages
3. Flag any question with <60% correct
4. Identify students <70% total → intervention list

### Misconception Tracking
| Misconception | Threshold | Action if > Threshold |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Bond energy | >30% wrong | Cycle 4 re-teach |
| Mass disappears | >25% wrong | Cycle 4 re-teach |
| Positive = good | >20% wrong | Quick review |

### Report to Generate
- Class average by section (A, B, C, D)
- Learning target mastery rates
- Misconception persistence rates
- Comparison to W1 and W2 exit tickets

---
